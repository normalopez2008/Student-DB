# Student-DB

Aldine High School is looking to build a database to help keep track of their 500 students. A database driven website will record student information as well as the classes information, tests the students will be taking and the teachers that will be teaching the classes. Aldine High School administration is looking to monitor student schedules and make sure testing is done in each class. This database will
help keep track of the number of students in each class and the teachers assigned to teach the class. Through the design and implementation of this database, administrative tasks will be streamlined and classroom allocations will be managed effectively and efficiently. This centralized database will help this high school to improve their allocation of resources, help enhance their understanding of their academic environment, and keep track of disciplinary incident information.
